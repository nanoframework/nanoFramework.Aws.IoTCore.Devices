Some notes to improve lib:

* Better documentation about ensuring "persistent" connections (or not) with documentation (including cloud policy doc for support)
* Add some integration tests, including (scripts to auto provision cloud broker (and/or)) manual setup documents to ensure ease of use.
* Partial Greengrass support?!
* Websocket support?!
* fleet provisioning support?!

## See it in action

TODO!

## Usage

**Important**: You **must** be connected to a network with a valid IP address **and** a valid date. Please check the examples with the Network Helpers on how to help you making sure you have both.

This AWS IoT SDK is using MQTT. So you need to ensure you can connect to port 8883 using TLS protocol. If you are in an enterprise network, this may be blocked. In most cases, this is not an issue.

If it is, in future, we plan to add WebSocket support.

The the name of the classes and the methods try to get close to the .NET C# Azure IoT SDK. This should allow an easier portability of the code between both cloud provider environments.

### Certificate

You have 2 options to provide the right Azure IoT TLS certificate:

- Pass it in the constructor
- Store it into the device

The [X.509Certificates](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/x509-client-certs.html) contain, for your convenience, the default root certificate used to connect to AWS IoT.

#### Thru the constructor

You will have to embed the certificate into your code, or add it as a resource:

```csharp
const string AwsRootCA = @"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDQTCCAimgAwIBAgITBmyfz5m/jAo54vB4ikPmljZbyjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsF
ADA5MQswCQYDVQQGEwJVUzEPMA0GA1UEChMGQW1hem9uMRkwFwYDVQQDExBBbWF6

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
";
MqttConnectionClient awsIoT = new MqttConnectionClient(IotBrokerAddress, ThingId, clientCert, MqttConnectionClient.QoSLevel.AtLeastOnce, awsRootCACert: new X509Certificate(AzureRootCA));
```

You can place your binary certificate in the resources as well and just get the certificate from it:

```csharp
X509Certificate awsRootCACert = new X509Certificate(Resources.GetBytes(Resources.BinaryResources.AwsCAcertificate));
MqttConnectionClient awsIoT = new MqttConnectionClient(IotBrokerAddress, ThingId, clientCert, MqttConnectionClient.QoSLevel.AtLeastOnce, awsRootCACert);
```

Note: when the certificate expires, you will have to reflash fully the device with the new certificate, or build a mechinisum into your code to include a primary and secondary certificate.

#### Storing the certificate into the device

You can store the certificate in the device flash and not in the code, so if you have to change the certificate, you'll just have to clean the current store and upload the new one. Edit the network properties:

![edit device network](device-network.jpg)

Navigate to the `General` tab:

![device network certificate](device-network-certificate.jpg)

Browse to choose your certificate, it can be in a binary (crt, der) or string form (pem, txt) and select ok. The certificate to connect will be selected automatically during the connection.

### Creating an MqttConnectionClient

You can connect to AWS IoT Core using a certificate containing the private certificate and key, or IAM (not currently supported). The following example shows how to create it:

```csharp
const string ThingId = "nanoDeviceShadow";
const string IotBrokerAddress = "<account>-ats.iot.<region>.amazonaws.com";
//make sure to add a correct pfx certificate
X509Certificate2 clientCert = new X509Certificate2(ClientRsaSha256Crt, ClientRsaKey, "");
MqttConnectionClient awseIoT = new MqttConnectionClient(IotBrokerAddress, ThingId, clientCert, MqttConnectionClient.QoSLevel.AtLeastOnce, awsRootCACert);

```

Note: please see the previous section to understand how to better pass the certificate for your usage. The example shows the certificate uploaded into the device and not in the code.

### Getting and updating Device Shadow

You can request your Azure IoT Twin simply by calling the `GetTwin` function.

```csharp
var shadow = awsIoT.GetShadow(new CancellationTokenSource(20000).Token);
if (shadow == null)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Can't get the shadow");
    awsIoT.Close();
    return;
}

Debug.WriteLine($"Shadow ClientToken: {shadow.DeviceId}, #desired: {shadow.status.desired}, #reported: {shadow.status.reported}");
```

Note: it's important to use a `CancellationToken` that be cancelled after a certain amount of time. Otherwise, this will be blocking the thread up to the point the shadow will be received. 

Shadows have status properties, reported and desired. They are a hashtable and you can get or try to get any element.

You can report your Shadow as simple as this:


TODO: does not work yet!!!
```csharp
ShadowCollection reported = new ShadowCollection();
reported.Add("firmware", "myNano");
reported.Add("sdk", 0.2);
awsIoT.UpdateReportedProperties(reported);
```

You also have the option to wait for the shadow update confirmation, in this case use a `CancellationToken` that can be cancelled. Otherwise the check will be ignored.

Note: the function will return false if the shadow reception confirmation is not checked or if it did not arrive on time.

You can also register for any shadow update:

```csharp
awsIoT.ShadowUpated += ShadowUpdatedEvent;

void ShadowUpdatedEvent(object sender, ShadowUpdateEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Shadow update received:  {e.Shadow}");
}
```

### Sending message

You have to use the `SendMessage` function to send any kind of message or telemetry to Aws IoT. As with the other function, you have the possibility to ensure delivery using a `CancellationToken` than can be cancelled. If one that can't be cancelled is used, the delivery insurance will be ignored and the function will return false.

```csharp
var isReceived = awsIoT.SendMessage($"{{\"Temperature\":42,\"Pressure\":1024}}", new CancellationTokenSource(5000).Token);
Debug.WriteLine($"Message received by IoT Core: {isReceived}");
```

Note: The message will be send with the same quality of service you created the connection with. You won't get any answer for the quality 0. In this case, you can simplify it to:

```csharp
awsIoT.SendMessage($"{{\"Temperature\":42,\"Pressure\":1024}}");
```

### Cloud to device messages

You can register an event to receive Cloud to device messages:


TODO: check works!!!

```csharp
awsIoT.CloudToDeviceMessage += CloudToDeviceMessageEvent;

// The following example shows how to display all keys in debug
void CloudToDeviceMessageEvent(object sender, CloudToDeviceMessageEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Message arrived: {e.Message}");
    foreach (string key in e.Properties.Keys)
    {
        Debug.Write($"  Key: {key} = ");
        if (e.Properties[key] == null)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("null");
        }
        else
        {
            Debug.WriteLine((string)e.Properties[key]);
        }
    }

    // e.Message contains the message itself
    if(e.Message == "stop")
    {
        ShoudIStop = true;
    }
}
```

Note: the `sender` is a `MqttConnectionClient` class, you can then send a message back with a confirmation or any logic you've put in place.

<!-- ### Method callback

Method callback is supported as well. You can register and unregister your methods. Here are a few examples:

```csharp
awsIoT.AddMethodCallback(MethodCallbackTest);
awsIoT.AddMethodCallback(MakeAddition);
awsIoT.AddMethodCallback(RaiseExceptionCallbackTest);

string MethodCallbackTest(int rid, string payload)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Call back called :-) rid={rid}, payload={payload}");
    return "{\"Yes\":\"baby\",\"itisworking\":42}";
}

string MakeAddition(int rid, string payload)
{
    Hashtable variables = (Hashtable)JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(payload, typeof(Hashtable));
    int arg1 = (int)variables["arg1"];
    int arg2 = (int)variables["arg2"];
    return $"{{\"result\":{arg1 + arg2}}}";
}

string RaiseExceptionCallbackTest(int rid, string payload)
{
    // This will properly return as well the exception error
    throw new Exception("I got you, it's to test the 504");
}
```

**Important**: method names are case sensitive. So make sure you name your functions in C# the same way. -->

### Status update event

A status update event is available:

```csharp
awsIoT.StatusUpdated += StatusUpdatedEvent;

void StatusUpdatedEvent(object sender, StatusUpdatedEventArgs e)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Status changed: {e.Status.State}, {e.Status.State}");
    // You may want to reconnect or use a similar retry mechanism
    ////if (e.Status.State == Status.Disconnected)
    ////{
    ////    mqtt.Open();
    ////}
}
```

Note that they are status change based, so once the connect or disconnect event arrives, they'll be replaced by other events as soon as something else happened like receiving a shadow.

<!-- ## Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service (DPS) support

This SDK supports as well Azure IoT Device Provisioning Service. Group and individual provisioning scenarios are supported either with a symmetric key either with certificates. To understand the mechanism behind DPS, it is recommended to read the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-dps/).

### Provisioning using symmetric key

For symmetric key provisioning you only need the following elements:

- A registration ID
- The ID Scope
- The device name
- The key or the derived key for group provisioning

The code is then straight forward:

```csharp
const string RegistrationID = "nanoDPStTest";
const string DpsAddress = "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net";
const string IdScope = "0ne01234567";
const string SasKey = "alongkeyencodedbase64";

// See the previous sections in the SDK help, you either need to have the Azure certificate embedded
// Either passing it in the constructor
X509Certificate azureCA = new X509Certificate(DpsSampleApp.Resources.GetBytes(DpsSampleApp.Resources.BinaryResources.BaltimoreRootCA_crt));
var provisioning = ProvisioningDeviceClient.Create(DpsAddress, IdScope, RegistrationID, SasKey, azureCA);
var myDevice = provisioning.Register(new CancellationTokenSource(60000).Token);

if(myDevice.Status != ProvisioningRegistrationStatusType.Assigned)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Registration is not assigned: {myDevice.Status}, error message: {myDevice.ErrorMessage}");
    return;
}

// You can then create the device
var device = new DeviceClient(myDevice.AssignedHub, myDevice.DeviceId, SasKey, nanoFramework.M2Mqtt.Messages.MqttQoSLevel.AtMostOnce, azureCA);
// Open it and continue like for the previous sections
var res = device.Open();
if(!res)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"can't open the device");
    return;
}
```

Note: like for the `DeviceClient` you need to make sure you are connected to a network properly and also have a proper data and time set on the device.

### Provisioning using certificates

For symmetric key provisioning you only need the following elements:

- A registration ID
- The ID Scope
- The device name
- The device certificate
- Make sure that your IoT Hub is as well aware of the root/intermediate certificate you are using otherwise you won't be able to connect to your IoT Hub once your device is provisioned

The code is then straight forward:

```csharp
const string RegistrationID = "nanoCertTest";
const string DpsAddress = "global.azure-devices-provisioning.net";
const string IdScope = "0ne0034F11A";

const string cert = @"
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
Your certificate
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
";

const string privateKey = @"
-----BEGIN ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
the encrypted private key
-----END ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY-----
";

// See the previous sections in the SDK help, you either need to have the Azure certificate embedded
// Either passing it in the constructor
X509Certificate azureCA = new X509Certificate(DpsSampleApp.Resources.GetBytes(DpsSampleApp.Resources.BinaryResources.BaltimoreRootCA_crt));
// Note: if your private key is not protected with a password, you don't need to pass it
// You can as well store your certificate directly in the device certificate store
// And you can store it as a resource as well if needed
X509Certificate2 deviceCert = new X509Certificate2(cert, privateKey, "1234");

var provisioning = ProvisioningDeviceClient.Create(DpsAddress, IdScope, RegistrationID, deviceCert, azureCA);
var myDevice = provisioning.Register(new CancellationTokenSource(60000).Token);

if(myDevice.Status != ProvisioningRegistrationStatusType.Assigned)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"Registration is not assigned: {myDevice.Status}, error message: {myDevice.ErrorMessage}");
    return;
}

// You can then create the device
var device = new DeviceClient(myDevice.AssignedHub, myDevice.DeviceId, deviceCert, nanoFramework.M2Mqtt.Messages.MqttQoSLevel.AtMostOnce, azureCA);
// Open it and continue like for the previous sections
var res = device.Open();
if(!res)
{
    Debug.WriteLine($"can't open the device");
    return;
}
```

### Additional payload

Additional payload is supported as well. You can set it up as as json string in the `ProvisioningRegistrationAdditionalData` class when calling the `Register` function. When the device has been provisioned, you may have as well additional payload provided. -->
